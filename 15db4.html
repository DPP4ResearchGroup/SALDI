<div>In addition, some community developed MALDI-based MSI pipeline has been made available through Mass Spectrometry Imaging Society&nbsp;(maldi-msi.org). Nevertheless, due to the co-existing of independent data formats depend on MSI instrumentation vendors, the MSI data analysis is largely independent practice in the past. &nbsp;The Recent adaptation of common imzML data format&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{22842151}</cite>&nbsp;within major instrument vendors has allowed the development of the independent analysing tools and more vivid statistical analysis to identify analyte distributions and colocalizations more accurately. Clustering techniques on MSI data is also very limited to mainly hierarchical cluster analysis and pricipal component analysisi&nbsp;</div><div></div>
